# OptPilot

OptPilot is an orchestrator for AI-assisted iterative optimization over measured objectives. It standardizes the study loop around configuration, candidate handoff, evaluation against target environments or evaluation harnesses, evidence capture, lineage, and reproducibility.

OptPilot is intentionally not an optimizer, simulator, RL framework, or LLM agent framework. Those parts remain user-owned. OptPilot provides the protocol that lets those components run as repeatable studies against a shared execution and evidence model.

## Alpha Status

This repository is at an initial alpha stage. The intended user-facing surface today is small and explicit:

- `EnvironmentConfig`: describes how an environment evaluates candidates and produces metrics and artifacts.
- `MethodConfig`: describes the user-owned controller and engine method.
- `StudyConfig`: binds one method to one environment with an objective, instances, and budget.
- CLI: `optpilot run`, `optpilot import-frontier`
- Python entrypoint: `optpilot.runner.run_study`

OptPilot compiles the three authoring files above into an internal `StudySpec` that is recorded in the run evidence. Most users should author the public configs, not hand-write `StudySpec`.

Included in the current alpha:

- v3alpha config loader and compiler
- `evaluate.type: python` and `evaluate.type: command`
- parameter and file candidate materialization
- candidate validation for parameter bounds and referenced file artifacts
- structured evidence capture into local JSONL and file-backed run directories
- pluggable controllers and engines through `python:module:Class`
- reference random search for examples and smoke tests
- resume and branch lineage metadata
- prompt and model provenance helpers for user-owned LLM-style engines
- Frontier-Engineering draft import support

Not included in the current alpha:

- built-in Bayesian optimization, RL, or LLM search algorithms
- remote execution backends
- strong sandbox isolation
- UI

## Install With uv

OptPilot now uses `uv` as the recommended project manager.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` 0.10+

Clone the repository, then create the local environment and install the package
in editable mode:

```bash
uv sync
```

Verify the CLI:

```bash
uv run optpilot --help
```

`uv sync` creates a local `.venv`, installs the package from `src/`, and uses
the checked-in `uv.lock` for reproducible dependency resolution.

## Quickstart

Run the reference toy study:

```bash
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_random_search.yaml
```

The command prints a JSON summary with fields such as `study_id`, `run_dir`, `completed_trials`, and `best_metric`. The run directory contains the audit and evidence records for that study, including:

- `study_spec.json`
- `summary.json`
- `observations.jsonl`
- `trials.jsonl`
- `artifacts.jsonl`
- `controller_decisions.jsonl`
- `scheduler_events.jsonl`

Other runnable examples in this repository:

```bash
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_cli_random_search.yaml
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_user_engine.yaml
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_lifecycle_engine.yaml
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_evidence_aware_controller.yaml
```

For an external-project code-edit example that uses an LLM engine to modify a
discrete-event simulator generated in another repository, see
[examples/opt_devs_gen_sims/README.md](examples/opt_devs_gen_sims/README.md).

## Authoring Model

Every OptPilot study is built from three small config files.

1. `EnvironmentConfig`
   Defines how OptPilot evaluates candidates. The current alpha supports Python
   callables, external commands, and custom adapters.
2. `MethodConfig`
   Defines the optimization method. This can point at a built-in reference
   engine or at user-owned Python classes for the controller and engine.
3. `StudyConfig`
   Selects the environment and method, then adds the objective, instances,
   execution settings, and stopping budget.

The reference toy study is exactly this pattern:

```yaml
apiVersion: optpilot.io/v3alpha1
kind: StudyConfig
name: toy-random-search

environment: ../environments/toy_factory.yaml
method: ../methods/reference_random_search.yaml

objective:
  metric: throughput
  direction: maximize

instances:
  source: files
  paths:
    - ../instances/toy_factory_case.yaml

budget:
  maxTrials: 12
```

For the full schema, see [docs/config_files_v3alpha.md](docs/config_files_v3alpha.md).

## User-Owned Python Hooks

OptPilot is designed so users own the search algorithm and, when needed, the environment adapter.

- Environment callables use `module:function` for `evaluate.type: python`.
- Controllers and engines use `python:module:Class`.
- Example user-owned components live under `examples/user_engines/` and
  `examples/user_controllers/`.

That means you can keep your optimization logic outside the OptPilot package itself while still getting the standard study runtime and evidence model.

## Common Commands

Resume an existing run directory:

```bash
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_user_engine.yaml \
  --resume-run-dir path/to/existing-run
```

Branch a new run from an earlier run:

```bash
uv run optpilot run examples/studies/toy_user_engine.yaml \
  --branch-from-run-dir path/to/existing-run
```

Generate a Frontier-Engineering draft config when a local copy of that external project exists under `resource/`:

```bash
uv run optpilot import-frontier \
  resource/Frontier-Engineering/benchmarks/Robotics/PIDTuning \
  --output frontier_pid_study.yaml
```

The `resource/` directory is intentionally ignored and is not part of the OptPilot release package.

## Development Checks

Run the repository checks with `uv`:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
uv run python -m compileall src/optpilot
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

The smoke script re-executes itself through `uv run` when needed.

## Local UI safety

The experimental `optpilot ui` server is unauthenticated and binds only to
`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. Open it directly at the printed local URL. Do not
expose it through a public proxy or port-forwarding service. Study launch
executes user-owned code with the current user's privileges; only use trusted
configs, engines, and environments. The UI restricts file previews to its static
assets and configured run roots (including output roots of UI-launched jobs).
Browser API mutations require same-origin JSON requests.
